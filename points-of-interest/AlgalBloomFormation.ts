      citation: "Sargassum is a type of macroalgae, its growth is often influenced by the same nutrient-rich conditions that boost phytoplankton, which lead to elevated chlorophyll levels. Monitoring chlorophyll concentrations over time can help us identify ocean regions experiencing eutrophication or nutrient upwelling—conditions that are conducive to Sargassum proliferation.",
