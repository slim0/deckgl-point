    description:
      "Chlorophyll levels in Bristol Bay serve as a key indicator within ecosystem-based fisheries management. Low chlorophyll signals reduced primary productivity, potentially impacting the food web that supports crab populations, particularly during early life stages. Monitoring chlorophyll provides valuable insight into the overall health and carrying capacity of the ecosystem, informing more holistic and precautionary management approaches for the crab fisheries.",
